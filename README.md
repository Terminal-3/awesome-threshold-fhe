# 🔐 Awesome Threshold FHE (ThFHE)

> A curated list of foundational and advanced research papers on **Threshold Fully Homomorphic Encryption**, inspired by [Andreea Alexandru’s MPTS 2023 talk](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/Presentations/2023/mpts2023-day3-talk-fhe-blocks/images-media/mpts2023-3c1-slides--andreea--threshold-FHE-blocks.pdf).

Threshold FHE allows multiple parties to collaboratively perform fully homomorphic encryption operations — including joint key generation, distributed evaluation, and threshold decryption — while maintaining cryptographic security even under passive or active adversarial models.
